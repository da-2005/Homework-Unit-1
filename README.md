# Horiseon-Refactoring

## Description
I was given an HTML file for refactoring in order to make it more accessible for potential individuals with disabilities. Additionallly, it was aksed to modify the HTML file so it would have the following:

- Semantic HTML elements
- The structure of HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Icon and image elements have accessible alt attributes
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order
- A concise and descriptive title element
- Make sure the links in the navigation bar function properly

On top of this, a CSS file was also requested to be worked on and required the file to be editied as needed so it would follow the HTML's semantic structure.
